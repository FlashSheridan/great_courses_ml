Code and data (and a little guidence) for "Introduction to Machine
Learning" (ML-teachco-9070), taught by Michael Littman for The Great
Courses.

The files here consist of several types:

- Files with names like Lxx.ipynb are the program files discussed in
  each of the specific lessons, 01 to 25. With these files, you can
  follow along with the lessons. Every lesson has such a file.

- Files with names like Lxxaux.ipynb are program files used by the
  instructor in the lesson, but that are not discussed explicitly.
  Not every lesson has one of these "auxillary" files.

- Files with names like Lxxqs.ipynb are program files associated with
  the practice problems for each lesson (problem 3 in the guidebook 
  for each lesson).
  
To execute any of these program files, use a link like:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/mlittmancs/great_courses_ml/blob/master/L02.ipynb ,

which is the program associated with the "Getting Start with Python
Notebooks and Colab" lesson, Lesson 02. Just take out the L02 and put
in L16qs or whatever the name of the file is that you want to work
with. Direct links to these files are provided in the course
guidebook.

To the extent it doesn't break functionality, sweeping other files
into a subfolder called OTHER, or distributing into lesson-specific
sub-sub folders would help move out of first-sight the other files.
For example, finding a lower-level place to put the text files, and
CSV files, and a stray JPG file that currently appear in the top level:



OK, in that case (so as not to let the "best" be the enemy of the "good"), just reorganize the zip file subfolder structure and write a short READ ME explaining what the files are.  The top level structure could be:

-README about Files Provided
-Getting Start with Python Notebooks and Colab (Lesson 2 guidebook file) - attached
-The Program Files [a top-level subfolder containing everything]

It's not clear to me whether the substructure inside "The Program Files" could get cleaned up in any way without breaking dependencies, but it's sounding like not.

Btw, we have been getting requests for the zipped program files from the course page support team, so as soon as you can turn to that would be welcome.
