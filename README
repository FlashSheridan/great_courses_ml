Code and data (and a little guidence) for "Introduction to Machine
Learning" (ML-teachco-9070), taught by Michael Littman for The Great
Courses.

For information getting started, please see:

- Getting Start with Python Notebooks and Colab (pdf of Lesson 02
  guidebook file): .

The files here consist of several types:

- Files with names like Lxx.ipynb are the program files discussed in
  each of the specific lessons, 01 to 25. With these files, you can
  follow along with the lessons. Every lesson has such a file.

- Files with names like Lxxaux.ipynb are program files used by the
  instructor in the lesson, but that are not discussed explicitly.
  Not every lesson has one of these "auxillary" files.

- Files with names like Lxxqs.ipynb are program files associated with
  the practice problems for each lesson (problem 3 in the guidebook 
  for each lesson).
  
To execute any of these program files, use a link like:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/mlittmancs/great_courses_ml/blob/master/L02.ipynb ,

which is the program associated with the "Getting Start with Python
Notebooks and Colab" lesson, Lesson 02. Just take out the L02 and put
in L16qs or whatever the name of the file is that you want to work
with. Direct links to these files are provided in the course
guidebook.

Also in this file repository are:

- imgs: A directory of images used by the program files.

- data: A directory of local datasets used by the program files.

- requirements.txt: A file required by colab that lists library
  dependencies.

- README: This file.
