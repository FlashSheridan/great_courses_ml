This README describes the code and data provided to accompany
"Introduction to Machine Learning" (ML-teachco-9070), taught by Michael 
Littman for The Great Courses.

ForÂ more information getting started, please see the accompanying file:

- Introduction to Machine Learning L02.pdf: This pdf is the section
  from the course guidebook that details how to get started with Python
  notebooks and Colab. For access to the rest of the guidebook, sign up
  for the course itself at TheGreatCourses.com!

The program files provided here consist of three types:

- FOLLOW ALONG during or after lessons using the program files with
  simple names like L01.ipynb, L02.ipynb, and so on. They are in the
  .ipynb format discussed in Lesson 02 and are included for each of the
  specific lessons, from 02 to 25.
  
- AUXILIARY ("aux") files are provided for background information for
  those curious to explore other elements that appear on screen during
  lessons: Files with names like L01aux, L03aux, and so on are
  
  .ipynb are program files used by the
  instructor in the lesson, but that are not discussed explicitly.
  Not every lesson has one of these "auxillary" files. Note: Even users making diligent use of the FOLLOW ALONG and QUESTIONS program files can skip attention to the AUXILIARY files without loss. 




- Files with names like Lxx.ipynb are the program files discussed in
  each of the specific lessons, 01 to 25. With these files, you can
  follow along with the lessons. Every lesson has such a file.

- Files with names like Lxxaux.ipynb are program files used by the
  instructor in the lesson, but that are not discussed explicitly.
  Not every lesson has one of these "auxillary" files.

- Files with names like Lxxqs.ipynb are program files associated with
  the practice problems for each lesson (problem 3 in the guidebook 
  for each lesson).
  
To execute any of these program files, use a link like:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/mlittmancs/great_courses_ml/blob/master/L02.ipynb ,

which is the program associated with the "Getting Start with Python
Notebooks and Colab" lesson, Lesson 02. Just take out the L02 and put
in L16qs or whatever the name of the file is that you want to work
with. Direct links to these files are provided in the course
guidebook.

Also in this file repository are:

- imgs: A directory of images used by the program files.

- data: A directory of local datasets used by the program files.

- requirements.txt: A file required by colab that lists library
  dependencies.

- README: This file.
